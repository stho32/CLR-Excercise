1. Are the premises and the conclusion stated as whole sentences, that is, containing subject, verb and object?
2. Are the premises and the conclusion likely to be true?
3. Are the premises and the conclusion clearly stated?
4. Are the logical connections between the premises and the conclusion clear?
5. Are the premises sufficient to lead to the conclusion, and if not, what additional premises are needed?
6. Are there some other potential causes that might lead to the same conclusion?
7. Will the conclusion still be valid if one or more of the premises are removed?

Please always write down the question and then your answer for the specific case you are evaluating.

Please also include a causal relation tree of the syllogistic statement you are checking in mermaid.

## More Prompts

#### 1. Check format of statement (Entity Existence)

- What is the subject, verb and object in this sentence : `your statement` .
  All 3 things are (most of the time) needed for a valid entity.

#### 2. Check validity of statement (Causality Existence)

- Is this a valid statement: `your statement`
   
#### 3. Check logical validity of causal connection

- ? Something is missing?

#### 4. Check sufficiency of causal connection

-  Please evaluate the following statement and tell me if the cause unavoidably leads to the effect: `if ... then ...`
#### 5. Check for missing premises

- I have a conclusion which is `conclusion` and one of our premises is `premise`. Please indicate one additional premise needed to make this a valid syllogistic statement.
